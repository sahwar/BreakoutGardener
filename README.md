**Breakout Gardener** is a framework application based on [Node.js®](https://nodejs.org/) using the [i2c-bus](https://github.com/fivdi/i2c-bus) library, typically to be run on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org).
The name is a pun on the Pimoroni [Breakout Garden](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/breakout-garden), as the project started out as a way to present various sensor data on that system's OLED display. As geeky projects often do, however, it eventually grew into something bigger, with more elaborate interworking...

Breakout Gardener currently supports the following devices and sensors (I2C unless otherwise noted) through modules:

- **ADS1015**: Texas Instruments ADS1015 Analog-To-Digital Converter ([example](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro-phat))
- **ADT7410**: Analog Devices ADT7410 Digital Temperature Sensor ([example](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4089))
- **ADXL343**: Analog Devices ADXL343 Triple-Axis Accelerometer ([example](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4097))
- **AS7262**: AMS AS7262 6-channel Spectral Sensor ([example](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/as7262-6-channel-spectral-sensor-spectrometer-breakout))

- **DRV2605**: Texas Instruments DRV2605 based Pimoroni Linear Actuator Haptic Breakout ([link](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/drv2605l-linear-actuator-haptic-breakout))
- **DS18B20**: Maxim Integrated DS18B20 Digital Thermometer ([1-Wire](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/1_wire)) ([example](https://www.adafruit.com/product/381))

- **TCS3472**: ams TCS3472 Color Light Sensor ([example](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro-phat))
- **TRACKBALL**: Pimoroni Trackball Breakout ([link](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/trackball-breakout))
- **VCNL4010**: Vishay Semiconductors VCNL4010 Proximity/Light Sensor ([example](https://www.adafruit.com/product/466))
- **VEML6075**: Vishay Semiconductors VEML6075 UVA and UVB Light Sensor ([example](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3964))

...as well as the following exclusive add-on module for electric car owners like myself... :grinning:

- **KEBAP30**: KEBA KeContact P30 series wallbox charging station ([link](https://www.keba.com/en/emobility/products/product-overview/product_overview))

It also supports additional display modes through its **SYSTEM**, **CLOCK** and **KOMPIS** modules, Apple® HomeKit™ integration through selected [proxy](https://github.com/xoblite/BreakoutGardener/tree/master/homekit) modules for [HAP-NodeJS](https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS), data [exposure](https://prometheus.io/) and related [visualization](https://grafana.com/) through its **PROMETHEUS** module, as well as a HTML5/CSS3 browser **DASHBOARD** module (see screenshot of version R2B above) that provides an overview of the current status and readings of all sensors and devices available on the system (nb. the "Shop" button is there just to support the tinkering community's favourite suppliers; [Pimoroni (UK)](https://pimoroni.com/) and [Adafruit Industries (US)](https://www.adafruit.com/) (no affiliation to either, I just like their products and geeky dedication to the cause :wink:)).

Anyway, without further ado:

*- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (I have tested with v10.16.x LTS)*
<br>*- Clone this repository*
<br>*- Install [i2c-bus](https://github.com/fivdi/i2c-bus) (I have tested with v5.1.0)*
<br>*- Run!*

Enjoy! :sunglasses:

...and if you do, please Star, and perhaps also tag me on Twitter ([@xoblite](https://twitter.com/xoblite) #BreakoutGardener). Thanks! :smile:
